    "description": "My name is Tomer and I’m a software engineer with a diverse background in coding, automation, and problem-solving. With a bachelor’s degree in computer science and experience from both a coding bootcamp and Moody’s rotational program, I’ve had the unique opportunity to work across QA, DevOps, and full-stack development teams. My career began as an e-commerce product data manager, where I developed a sharp eye for detail and efficiency. It was there that I took matters into my own hands and used the minimal coding knowledge I had to build automation scripts for the company. Since then, I’ve combined my love for coding and automation to craft solutions that are not only functional but also elegant and maintainable. Whether I’m optimizing release pipelines, building robust APIs, or ensuring seamless user experiences, I’m driven by a passion for creating systems that work smarter. Let’s build something amazing together!",
